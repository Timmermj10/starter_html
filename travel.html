            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>
                Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and
                provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas. In fact, Yellowstone contains
                about half the world's active geysers.
            </p>
            <p>
                These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists. Every year visitors
                injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals. You can see examples of people making
                bad decisions by visiting <a

                The Apostle Islands are a collection of 22 islands in Lake Superior located in the northern region of
                Wisconsin, USA. Originally inhabited by the Ojibwe (Chippewa) people, the islands contain over hundreds
                of years worth of rich Native American history. In 1970, 21 of the islands and the surrounding waters
                were designated as the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, a protected area managed by the National Park
                Service. Lastly, the islands are home to a diverse range of wildlife, including, white-tailed deer,
                black bears and various bird species.

                There are six lighthouses spread across the islands, making it one of the largest collections of
                lighthouses in the United States. When the island receives visitors it is viewed as a popular
                destination for outdoor activities such as kayaking, sailing, hiking and camping. In addition, many
                people enjoy other activities such as berry picking. Camping is also allowed in 19 of the 21 islands to

                Auckland is the largest city in New Zealand located on the Northern Island of the country. The city’s
                population is just below 1.7 million people. Auckland is known as the “City of Sails” for its plethora
                of sailboats and yachts. The vast amount of waterfronts and harbors are conveniently located for sailors
                to embark on their hobbies.
